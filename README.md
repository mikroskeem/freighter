## Freighter

Freighter is a basic shell script for setting up and deploying zfs and docker.

Current features:

- Deploys zfs
- Deploys docker

Advantages:

- Flatcar and rancher are poor choices, and not as configurable as a script made from the ground-up.

### Usage

Before using freighter, ensure that a shell is installed, weather this be your literal operating system or something like Git bash on Windows.

Then, after downloading or cloning the `setup.sh` file, run

```
./setup.sh
```
